> The main purpose of this repository is to document the main Git CLI commands that I use throughout my projects, because I see myself forgeting some of the commands that I use most of the time.
> I know that there are a lot of Git Cheatsheet pictures, websites, git repos, etc, but I decided to make my own repository because it's easier for me to search on my own profile than elsewhere on the internet.
